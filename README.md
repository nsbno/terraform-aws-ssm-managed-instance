# terraform-aws-ssm-managed-instance
A Terraform module for creating an AWS Systems Manager activation that can be used to manage on-premises instances (Linux) in AWS. The module is more geared towards long-lived managed instances ("pets"), and not instances that are treated as ephemeral ("cattle").

A set of useful modules that can be used to extend the functionality are available under [modules](modules).
